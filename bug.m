In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves incorrect usage of `self` within methods, especially when dealing with properties or other instance variables.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)setMyString:(NSString *)newString {
    [self setMyString:newString]; // Incorrect recursive call
    // ... other code ...
}
@end
```

The recursive call `[self setMyString:newString]` creates an infinite loop, leading to a stack overflow. The correct approach should directly assign the value to the property:

```objectivec
- (void)setMyString:(NSString *)newString {
    _myString = newString; // Correct assignment
    // ... other code ...
}
```
Another subtle issue often arises with memory management and retain cycles. If you're not careful with strong references, you can easily create retain cycles between objects, preventing them from being deallocated, and leading to memory leaks.
