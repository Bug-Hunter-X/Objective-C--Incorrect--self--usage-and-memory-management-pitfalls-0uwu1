The solution addresses the problems presented in `bug.m`:

```objectivec
// bugSolution.m
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)setMyString:(NSString *)newString {
    _myString = newString; // Correct assignment
}

// ... corrected memory management code (example using weak references) ...
@end
```
The corrected code directly assigns the new string to the `_myString` property, eliminating the infinite recursion.  The memory management problem would be solved using appropriate weak references to break retain cycles. The specific implementation for memory management correction will depend on the nature of the retain cycles present in the original buggy code.
